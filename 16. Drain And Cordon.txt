Drain a Node

for some maintainance we have to drain node
if we have created pod it will be evicted if we created deployment it will be migratated to some other node


kubectl get nodes
kubectl drain node <node-name>
kubectl drain node <node-name> --force --ignore-daemonsets 
kubectl uncordon <node name>  #this will remove the 
kubectl get pods

drain (NoSchedule) all the living pods will be removed.
cordon (NoExecute) pods which are running will keep on running no new pods will be assign to this pod.
